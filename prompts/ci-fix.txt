# CI Auto-Fix — Targeted Repair

You are fixing a **specific, trivial CI failure** on PR #{{PR_NUMBER}} in `{{REPO}}`.

## PR Context
- **Title:** {{PR_TITLE}}
- **Branch:** {{PR_BRANCH}}

## Failure Details

The test/lint run failed with the following errors:

```
{{FAILURE_CONTEXT}}
```

## Your Mission

1. **Read the error output carefully.** Identify the exact files and line numbers.
2. **Fix ONLY the reported errors.** Do not refactor, do not improve, do not touch anything else.
3. **Run the failing command** to verify your fix resolves the issue.
4. **Commit and push** with message: `fix: resolve CI lint/type/format errors`

## Critical Rules

- **NO scope creep.** Fix the reported errors and nothing else.
- **Do NOT add new features, refactor code, or "improve" surrounding code.**
- **Do NOT modify test expectations** — fix the source code to match.
- **Do NOT add new dependencies** unless the error specifically requires one.
- If you cannot fix the error with a simple, targeted change, post a comment saying the error needs manual attention and run `/exit`.

## When Done

After committing and pushing your fix, post a PR comment:

```
CI auto-fix applied: [brief description of what was fixed]

<!-- agent-ci-fix-applied -->
```

Then run `/exit`.
